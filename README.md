# OTTO
A car shopping app that streamlines the car shopping experience!

* **Purpose of the app:** 
   This app was created to provide both customers and dealerships a simple and straightforward process for making car deals. It allows the customer to place a request for a car that they are interested in. The car request is sent to dealerships that have the car in stock and the dealer is given the opportunity send an offer to the customer with their best price. Once the customer receives an offer, they may choose to accept or decline the offer. This process incentivizes the dealer to give their best offer possible since many dealers will be making offers on the same customer request.
